Users register with multi layer for verification that they're actually a nigerian student.

There are 3 layers.

They select their school, then verify with their matric number.

And then their Jamb registration number.

We then get the information about them from the NELF API and we store the following information
```
      "data": {
        "RegNumber": "202330058799JA",
        "NIN": "96067494361",
